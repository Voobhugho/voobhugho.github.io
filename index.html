<h3>About: Eating Disorders</h3>

<p>What exactly is an eating disorder? An eating disorder can generally be defined as "mental health conditions marked by an obsession with food or body shape."5  Such eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, where people obsess and monitor their weight and severely restrict to get or stay ‘skinny’, bulimia nervosa, where people binge large amounts of food only to later purge via vomiting, laxatives, etc, binge eating disorder, where people binge large amounts of food often with little self control and do not purge later, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, where (as the name suggests) people restrict their food intake and/or avoid certain foods.5  These are a few of the most common eating disorders as well as the main eating disorders researched in this topic.

<h3>About: Covid</h3>
<p>What exactly is Covid? Covid-19, or coronavirus, is a disease that spread worldwide in December of 2019. It causes cold-like symptoms and can be deadly to those with underlying medical conditions as well as older adults. The disease has taken over 5 million lives so far and more to come. Due to covid-, certain restrictions have been put in place to lessen the likelihood of the disease spreading. In the US, these include social distancing, mask wearing, and quarantine. Many schools, universities, workplaces and the like have done their best to switch their work-models to completely virtual until further notice. Covid has caused many places to go out of business and has taken a hard hit on the economy in the US.

<h3>About: Interplay Between the Two</h3>
<p> Just how does covid affect not only eating disorders, but eating habits, and how do they interplay? Due to the quarantine and the mass panic because of Covid, people have been stocking up on and even hoarding the essentials: water, toilet paper, and yes, especially food. In the beginning of covid, this lack of food in stores caused people's eating habits to change, and for those with eating disorders, it perhaps had even worse consequences. Another aspect of covid that seems to have had an impact on everyone, including those with eating disorders, are the results of social isolation and quarantine. This lack of social interaction has been proven to have negative effects on people’s mental health as we are naturally social creatures.

<center><h2><a id="PROPOSAL">Research Proposal</a></h2></center>

<p>Covid has had an effect on all of us, whether we like it or not. It affects us on individual levels, on group levels, work levels, and so on. The purpose of this research proposal is to focus on how Covid has affected a specific group of people: those with eating disorders. It will focus on what we know about the research that has already been done, collecting new data via online surveys to compare and fill in the gaps previous research has left out, offer another perspective, and finally, answer an important question based on the results received that has yet to be asked and taken action on: What can we do to help? The goal of this project is to find specific effects covid has had on those with eating disorders and figure out what we can do to counteract those effects and improve the lives of those with eating disorders during covid as well as after covid.. But why focus on people with eating disorders? Why is this so important? Well, seeing as almost 10% of the US population has or has had an eating disorder and over 30 million people in the US alone have or have had an eating disorder at some point, it seems like something that we must take action to help.5 That’s around one in every ten people that has an eating disorder. This is a significant issue that needs more attention and more research.

</p>
<p>But before we can dive into the whats and hows of the proposal, we must first do some textual analysis of what research has already been done on this topic, which sadly isn’t much. Because covid is relatively new, there hasn’t been much research done on how it affects specific groups of people as much of the research done is on the virus itself and finding a solution to it. That said, there have been a few studies done already for us to take from. Here are some of the prevalent studies that have been published.
