<h3>About: Eating Disorders</h3>

<p>What exactly is an eating disorder? An eating disorder can generally be defined as "mental health conditions marked by an obsession with food or body shape."5  Such eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, where people obsess and monitor their weight and severely restrict to get or stay ‘skinny’, bulimia nervosa, where people binge large amounts of food only to later purge via vomiting, laxatives, etc, binge eating disorder, where people binge large amounts of food often with little self control and do not purge later, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, where (as the name suggests) people restrict their food intake and/or avoid certain foods.5  These are a few of the most common eating disorders as well as the main eating disorders researched in this topic.
</p>
<h3>About: Covid</h3>
<p>What exactly is Covid? Covid-19, or coronavirus, is a disease that spread worldwide in December of 2019. It causes cold-like symptoms and can be deadly to those with underlying medical conditions as well as older adults. The disease has taken over 5 million lives so far and more to come. Due to covid-, certain restrictions have been put in place to lessen the likelihood of the disease spreading. In the US, these include social distancing, mask wearing, and quarantine. Many schools, universities, workplaces and the like have done their best to switch their work-models to completely virtual until further notice. Covid has caused many places to go out of business and has taken a hard hit on the economy in the US. 
</p>
<h3>About: Interplay Between the Two</h3>
<p> Just how does covid affect not only eating disorders, but eating habits, and how do they interplay? Due to the quarantine and the mass panic because of Covid, people have been stocking up on and even hoarding the essentials: water, toilet paper, and yes, especially food. In the beginning of covid, this lack of food in stores caused people's eating habits to change, and for those with eating disorders, it perhaps had even worse consequences. Another aspect of covid that seems to have had an impact on everyone, including those with eating disorders, are the results of social isolation and quarantine. This lack of social interaction has been proven to have negative effects on people’s mental health as we are naturally social creatures.

<center><h2><a id="PROPOSAL">Research Proposal</a></h2></center>

<p>Covid has had an effect on all of us, whether we like it or not. It affects us on individual levels, on group levels, work levels, and so on. The purpose of this research proposal is to focus on how Covid has affected a specific group of people: those with eating disorders. It will focus on what we know about the research that has already been done, collecting new data via online surveys to compare and fill in the gaps previous research has left out, offer another perspective, and finally, answer an important question based on the results received that has yet to be asked and taken action on: What can we do to help? The goal of this project is to find specific effects covid has had on those with eating disorders and figure out what we can do to counteract those effects and improve the lives of those with eating disorders during covid as well as after covid.. But why focus on people with eating disorders? Why is this so important? Well, seeing as almost 10% of the US population has or has had an eating disorder and over 30 million people in the US alone have or have had an eating disorder at some point, it seems like something that we must take action to help.5 That’s around one in every ten people that has an eating disorder. This is a significant issue that needs more attention and more research.

</p>
<p>But before we can dive into the whats and hows of the proposal, we must first do some textual analysis of what research has already been done on this topic, which sadly isn’t much. Because covid is relatively new, there hasn’t been much research done on how it affects specific groups of people as much of the research done is on the virus itself and finding a solution to it. That said, there have been a few studies done already for us to take from. Here are some of the prevalent studies that have been published.
</p>
<p>An article published in the Journal of Eating Disorders by Stephen Touyz, Hubert Lacey, and Phillipa Hay predicts that due to quarantine, many outlets people with eating disorders use to get help may find alternative methods due to covid such as going online or worse, taking a hiatus or falling out of business, all of which become much less convenient for those who are seeking the help they need.1 They point out in their article that, “Many of our patients have rigid and inflexible eating behaviours with a very small range of foods that they can eat, and these are often brand related. At a time of food insecurity with bare supermarket shelves, brands may not be available resulting in less choice and increased risk of precipitous weight loss. The increasing news streaming regarding food insecurity may well act as a trigger for those who are ‘hoarders’ of food.”1 Already, we are seeing the effects of covid on those with restrictive/avoidant eating disorders as well as those who are hoarders of food. Furthermore, the authors bring attention to quarantine’s effect on those with bulimia and binge eating disorders.1 Being at home and unable to distance oneself from food could cause excessive binging on food that cannot easily be restocked due to both food shortages in stores and the increasing financial instability covid has caused, costing millions of people their jobs and, in turn, their incomes.1 Many people cannot afford to binge. Finally, the authors talk about covid’s effects on those with anorexia, who tend to be underweight, sometimes severely, and are physically compromised and more susceptible to illness because of it.1  
</p>
<p>Another study done by Dawn Branley-Bell and Catherine Talbot in the Journal of Eating Disorders sent out an online survey to 129 UK individuals suffering from or recovering from an eating disorder asking about different impacts of covid.2 The results showed that in 86.7% of their sample, covid had made their eating disorder symptoms worse.2 They also found that, “Eight key themes were generated: Disruption to living situation, increased social isolation and reduced access to usual support networks, changes to physical activity rates, reduced access to healthcare services, disruption to routine and perceived control, changes to relationship with food, increased exposure to triggering messages, and positive outcomes.”2 These key themes all had detrimental effects on the psychological wellbeing of those with eating disorders.2 The researchers concluded that there is a vital need for intervention among this population during covid.2
</p>
<p>Isabel Baenas and her crew put out another study for the European Eating Disorder Review in Early 2020 to “assess the level of deterioration in functioning of ED patients during confinement, due to COVID-19, and examine potential contributing factors.”3 In this study, a total of 74 eating disorder patients in treatment contributed to a telephone survey “regarding five main thematic blocks to explore: (a) socio-demographic information; (b) ED-status; (c) COVID-19 concerns; (d) pandemic stress (anxiety, depressive symptoms, other situations, and family conflicts) and, (e) coping strategies.”3 Their findings included that 70.3% of those involved in the study had concerns related to the confinement for covid.3 Symptom evolution worsened during the confinement due ot covid in 25.7% of those involved and in another 51.4% symptoms became less dominant.3 This suggests that about a quarter of patients showed a deterioration in symptoms.3
</p>
<p>In the final study done by Jet D. Termorshuizen and his crew for the International Journal of Eating Disorders in July of 2020, they “evaluated the early impact of COVID-19 on people with self-reported eating disorders.”4 This study took place in the form of an online survey given to 511 people in the US and 510 people in the Netherlands.4 Their findings included, “Participants with anorexia nervosa (US 62% of sample; NL 69%) reported increased restriction and fears about being able to find foods consistent with their meal plan.4 Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (US 30% of sample; NL 15%) reported increases in their binge-eating episodes and urges to binge.”4 Oddly enough,more than one third of participants found that covid brought positive life changes, such as connections with loved ones, focusing on recovery goals, and engaging in coping skills.4
</p>
<p>After looking into these studies, one might wonder how the results of each are so different despite it being the same population going through and responding to the same event. How can one study say almost all of their participants suffered from negative effects due to covid while another claims almost half of their participants’ symptoms became less dominant during covid? There are differences in places, ranging from the US to the Netherlands in all of these studies, in different sample sizes and different criteria for participants as well as so many other aspects. This is why I propose a research proposal on this same topic that takes place at Portland State University. 
</p>
<p>So, my research question is the following: What are covid’s effects on eating disorders within the population of Portland State? 

My hypothesis for this study matches the research that has already been done. I believe there will not be an overwhelming amount of students who have negative or positive effects, but rather a not so even ratio of both, leaning more towards the side of negative effects. If my hypothesis is confirmed, it might just add another layer of confirming evidence to the aforementioned studies and lead us one step closer to figuring out what steps can be taken to help those with eating disorders during covid as well as after. If my hypothesis is disconfirmed it would prompt new questions considering the hows and whys and perhaps even leading to a new or revised study. 

</p>
<p>Now, as for conducting my own study here at Portland State, I will use the same method as all of the other studies done on this topic: qualitative research in the form of surveys. After all, we are still in covid times where interviews may not be convenient for all, especially when compared to an online survey. Similarly, online surveys are much easier and convenient to retrieve data from and analyze.
</p>
<p>I will select my participants for the study from the population of Portland State. Criteria will include participants being admitted PSU students and currently having a diagnosed or self-diagnosed eating disorder including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and restrictive/avoidant food intake disorder for the purposes of my study. These participants would then take my online anonymous survey in which they would answer open and closed ended questions about the impact of covid on their eating disorders and eating habits, questions about quarantine and quality of life, symptoms and severity before and during covid, coping methods, and other things related to the study. I plan to reach my participants through resources at PSU, such as the PSU Student Health and Counseling, groups and clubs made among students, and simple word of mouth via students.
</p>
<p>After my survey has been conducted and the results are back, data will start to be collected from it and compared to data taken from other studies found by textual analysis. From here, all of the data will be compared, contrasted, and overall analyzed to see the true effects of covid’s effects on eating disorders pertaining to students at Portland State. Once I have my results, I would compare it to my hypothesis to see if it has been confirmed or disconfirmed. Either way, from the results received, it would be possible to find effective methods to help with the negative effects participants in the survey were experiencing due to covid and furthermore apply said methods to help those with eating disorders affected negatively by covid, especially at Portland State where the study would be conducted, and hopefully even further out into the world.
</p>
<p>
The research that would be conducted in this study is important as it is a precursor to figuring out just how we can help and counter against the negative effects covid is having on eating disorder sufferers everywhere and truly advance on eating disorder research and improvement, hopefully even when covid has become a thing of the past. As stated earlier, almost 10% of the US population has or has had an eating disorder in their lifetime. This gives us even more reason to do what we can to take this statistic down. This research could potentially invoke people involved, at Portland State and beyond, to find more solutions and methods of help for those with eating disorders, perhaps bringing together more of a community, a safe haven, where people could find comfort and console for years to come as well as advance in further eating disorder research.
